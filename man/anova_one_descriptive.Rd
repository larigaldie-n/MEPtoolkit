\title{Reconstruct One-Way ANOVA F-Test from Group Descriptive Statistics}
\usage{
anova_one_descriptive(m, s, n, output = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{Character vector. Reported mean for each group. Must be character
(not numeric) to allow inference of rounding precision (e.g., \code{"2.5"}
vs \code{"2.50"})}

\item{s}{Character vector. Reported standard deviation for each group. Must
be character for the same reason as \code{m}. Length must equal length of
\code{m}}

\item{n}{Numeric vector. Sample size for each group (integers ≥ 1). Length
must equal length of \code{m}}

\item{output}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, prints the result before returning.
Default is \code{FALSE}}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link{Anova_res}} containing:
  \describe{
    \item{Min}{Minimum possible p-value from the reconstructed ANOVA}
    \item{RIVETS}{P-value computed from the reported (central) values}
    \item{Max}{Maximum possible p-value from the reconstructed ANOVA}
    \item{Function}{Character string \code{"anova_one_descriptive"}}
  }
}
\description{
Reconstructs the omnibus F-test p-value from a one-way ANOVA using only the
reported means, standard deviations, and sample sizes for each group. This
allows verification of reported ANOVA results when only descriptive statistics
are published. The function accounts for rounding uncertainty by computing a
range of plausible p-values.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
  \item Converts each reported mean and SD to a plausible interval using
    \code{\link{validate_descriptive}}, which accounts for rounding precision
  \item Generates all combinations of minimum/original/maximum values for all
    group means and SDs (3^(2k) combinations where k is the number of groups)
  \item For each combination, reconstructs the one-way ANOVA using standard
    formulas:
    \itemize{
      \item Grand mean: \eqn{\bar{X}_{..} = \frac{\sum n_i \bar{X}_i}{\sum n_i}}
      \item Between-groups mean square: \eqn{MS_B = \frac{\sum n_i(\bar{X}_i - \bar{X}_{..})^2}{k-1}}
      \item Within-groups mean square: \eqn{MS_W = \frac{\sum (n_i-1)s_i^2}{\sum n_i - k}}
      \item F-statistic: \eqn{F = \frac{MS_B}{MS_W}}
      \item P-value: \eqn{P(F_{k-1, N-k} > F_{observed})}
    }
    where k is the number of groups and N is the total sample size
  \item Records the minimum and maximum p-values across all combinations,
    plus the p-value from the reported (central) values
}

The reconstruction assumes:
\itemize{
  \item All groups are independent
  \item Reported SDs are sample standard deviations (not standard errors)
  \item The original analysis used a standard one-way ANOVA (not Welch's
    heteroscedastic variant)
}
}
\section{Use Cases}{

\itemize{
  \item \strong{Verification}: Check whether a reported ANOVA p-value is
    consistent with the reported descriptive statistics
  \item \strong{Missing p-values}: Estimate ANOVA results when only
    descriptive statistics are published
  \item \strong{Error detection}: Identify potential transcription errors or
    inconsistencies in reported results
  \item \strong{Meta-analysis}: Extract effect sizes or p-values from papers
    that only report means and SDs
}
}

\section{Interpretation}{

\itemize{
  \item If a reported ANOVA p-value falls outside the [Min, Max] range,
    this suggests inconsistency or potential errors in the reported results
  \item Wide ranges indicate high sensitivity to rounding (common with
    small sample sizes or highly rounded values)
  \item The RIVETS value represents the best estimate given the reported
    central values
}
}

\section{Assumptions and Limitations}{

\itemize{
  \item Assumes equal variance across groups (standard ANOVA assumption).
    For heteroscedastic alternatives, consider Welch's ANOVA instead
  \item Requires at least 2 groups (k ≥ 2)
  \item Very small sample sizes (e.g., n < 5 per group) increase sensitivity
    to rounding
  \item Cannot detect whether original analysis used different variants
    (e.g., Type I vs Type III sums of squares for unbalanced designs,
    though this distinction only matters with covariates)
  \item The number of combinations grows exponentially with the number of
    groups (3^(2k)), which may slow computation for many groups (k > 10)
