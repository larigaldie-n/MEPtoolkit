\title{Assess Robustness of Descriptive Statistics to Removal of Extreme Values}
\usage{
range_killer(m, s, n, min, max, data = NULL, output = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{Character scalar or vector. Reported sample mean(s). Can be formatted
numbers (e.g., \code{"10.5"}) that may represent rounded values}

\item{s}{Character scalar or vector. Reported sample standard deviation(s)
(same format as \code{m})}

\item{n}{Numeric scalar or vector. Sample size(s) (integers ≥ 4). Must be at
least 4 because the analysis removes 2 observations and requires degrees of
freedom for SD calculation}

\item{min}{Character scalar or vector. Reported minimum value(s) in the sample
(same format as \code{m})}

\item{max}{Character scalar or vector. Reported maximum value(s) in the sample
(same format as \code{m})}

\item{data}{Data frame, optional. If provided, other arguments are interpreted
as column names (quoted or unquoted) within \code{data}}

\item{output}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, prints the result before returning.
Default is \code{FALSE}}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link{Range_killer_res}} containing six
  numeric vectors:
  \describe{
    \item{Min_mean}{Minimum possible mean after removing extremes}
    \item{RIVETS_mean}{Mean recalculated from reported (central) values}
    \item{Max_mean}{Maximum possible mean after removing extremes}
    \item{Min_sd}{Minimum possible SD after removing extremes (or \code{-1}
      if impossible)}
    \item{RIVETS_sd}{SD recalculated from reported (central) values (or
      \code{-1} if impossible)}
    \item{Max_sd}{Maximum possible SD after removing extremes (or \code{-1}
      if impossible)}
  }
}
\description{
Evaluates the sensitivity of reported summary statistics (mean and standard
deviation) to the removal of extreme observations. This function computes
bounds on what the mean and SD would be if the minimum and maximum values
were removed from the sample, accounting for rounding uncertainty in all
reported statistics. Useful for detecting reporting errors or assessing the
influence of outliers on published results.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps for each case:
\enumerate{
  \item Converts each reported statistic (mean, SD, min, max) into a plausible
    interval using \code{\link{validate_descriptive}}, which accounts for
    rounding precision
  \item Generates all combinations of minimum/original/maximum values for the
    four statistics (3^4 = 81 combinations per case)
  \item For each combination, recalculates the mean and SD that would result
    if the minimum and maximum observations were removed from the sample
  \item Records the minimum and maximum recalculated values across all
    combinations, plus the values computed from the reported (central)
    statistics
}

The recalculations use standard algebraic identities:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{New mean}: \eqn{\bar{x}' = \frac{n\bar{x} - (x_{min} + x_{max})}{n - 2}}
  \item \strong{Original sum of squares}: \eqn{SS = (n-1)s^2 + n\bar{x}^2}
  \item \strong{New sum of squares}: \eqn{SS' = SS - (x_{min}^2 + x_{max}^2)}
  \item \strong{New variance}: \eqn{s'^2 = \frac{SS' - (n-2)\bar{x}'^2}{n-3}}
  \item \strong{New SD}: \eqn{s' = \sqrt{s'^2}} (or \code{-1} if \eqn{s'^2 < 0})
}

When the recalculated variance is negative, this indicates an impossible or
inconsistent combination of statistics, and the SD is set to \code{-1} as a
flag value.
}
\section{Use Cases}{

\itemize{
  \item \strong{Error detection}: If recalculated statistics are impossible
    (SD = \code{-1}), the original reported values may be inconsistent or
    contain errors
  \item \strong{Outlier influence}: Large differences between original and
    trimmed statistics suggest strong influence of extreme values
  \item \strong{Robustness assessment}: Narrow ranges around RIVETS values
    indicate statistics that are relatively stable to removal of extremes
  \item \strong{Reporting verification}: Can help verify whether reported
    ranges (min/max) are plausible given reported mean and SD
}
}

\section{Assumptions and Limitations}{

\itemize{
  \item Sample size must be at least 4 (n ≥ 4) to allow removal of 2
    observations while maintaining sufficient degrees of freedom (n-3 ≥ 1)
  \item The function assumes the reported minimum and maximum represent actual
    observed values, not theoretical or truncated ranges
  \item Very small samples (n = 4 or 5) may be highly sensitive to rounding,
    producing wide bounds
  \item The \code{-1} flag for impossible SDs is a sentinel value; do not
    interpret it as a meaningful statistic

# Check for impossible statistics (inconsistent reporting)
suspicious <- range_killer(
  m = "10.0", s = "0.5", n = 10,
  min = "5.0", max = "15.0"  # Range too wide for this mean/SD
)
# If RIVETS_sd is -1, the reported values are inconsistent
