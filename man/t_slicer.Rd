\title{Test Consistency of Reported t-Test Results with Descriptive Statistics}
\usage{
t_slicer(m1, s1, n1, m2, s2, n2, p = NULL, data = NULL, output = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{m1}{Character scalar or vector. Reported mean(s) for group 1. Can be
formatted numbers (e.g., \code{"1.23"}) that may represent rounded values}

\item{s1}{Character scalar or vector. Reported standard deviation(s) for
group 1 (same format as \code{m1})}

\item{n1}{Numeric scalar or vector. Sample size(s) for group 1 (integers ≥ 2)}

\item{m2}{Character scalar or vector. Reported mean(s) for group 2 (same
format as \code{m1})}

\item{s2}{Character scalar or vector. Reported standard deviation(s) for
group 2 (same format as \code{s1})}

\item{n2}{Numeric scalar or vector. Sample size(s) for group 2 (integers ≥ 2)}

\item{p}{Character scalar or vector, optional. Reported p-value(s). Can be
\code{NA} or omitted when no p-value is reported. Default is \code{NULL}}

\item{data}{Data frame, optional. If provided, the other arguments are
interpreted as column names (quoted or unquoted) within \code{data}}

\item{output}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, prints a summary and displays
diagnostic plots before returning the result object. Default is \code{FALSE}}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link{T_slicer_res}} containing:
  \describe{
    \item{Student_min, Student_RIVETS, Student_max}{Minimum, reported-value,
      and maximum plausible p-values for Student's t-test (pooled variance)}
    \item{Welch_min, Welch_RIVETS, Welch_max}{Analogous p-values for
      Welch's t-test (unequal variance)}
    \item{Student}{Logical vector indicating whether reported p-value is
      consistent with Student's t-test (\code{TRUE} = consistent,
      \code{FALSE} = inconsistent, \code{NA} = no reported p)}
    \item{Welch}{Logical vector indicating consistency with Welch's t-test
      (same interpretation as \code{Student})}
    \item{Plots}{List of \pkg{ggplot2} objects visualizing p-value ranges
      and reported p-intervals for each case}
  }
}
\description{
Determines which two-sample t-test variant (Student's pooled-variance or
Welch's unequal-variance) is consistent with reported summary statistics.
When p-values are provided, the function checks whether they align with
either test. The analysis accounts for rounding imprecision by computing
plausible intervals around reported values.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps for each case:
\enumerate{
  \item Converts each reported descriptive statistic (means and SDs) into a
    plausible interval using \code{\link{validate_descriptive}}, which
    accounts for rounding precision
  \item Generates all combinations of minimum/maximum values for the four
    descriptive statistics (two means, two SDs)
  \item Computes two-sample t-test p-values for each combination using
    \code{\link[BSDA]{tsum.test}} with both \code{var.equal = TRUE}
    (Student's t-test) and \code{var.equal = FALSE} (Welch's t-test)
  \item Records the minimum and maximum p-values across all combinations,
    plus the p-value computed from the reported (central) values (RIVETS)
  \item If a reported p-value is provided, converts it to an interval via
    \code{\link{validate_p}} and checks whether it overlaps with the
    plausibility intervals for each test
  \item Creates a diagnostic plot showing the p-value ranges and, when
    applicable, the reported p-interval as a colored rectangle (green for
    consistent, red for inconsistent)
}

This function is particularly useful for:
\itemize{
  \item Verifying which t-test variant was likely used in published analyses
  \item Detecting potential errors in reported statistics
  \item Preparing inputs for more detailed consistency analyses (e.g.,
    \code{carlisle} tests)
}
}
\section{Assumptions and Limitations}{

\itemize{
  \item Sample sizes should be integers ≥ 2. Very small samples (n < 5)
    increase sensitivity to rounding and may produce unstable results
  \item All reported values are assumed to be rounded to the precision
    indicated by their string representation
  \item The function assumes independent samples and approximately normal
    distributions within groups (standard t-test assumptions)
}
